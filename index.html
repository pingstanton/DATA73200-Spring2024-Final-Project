<em>(from <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/modern-art" target="_blank">MoMA.org's website</a>)</em><br />
<br />
<blockquote>"Modern art is generally described as art produced after the Industrial Revolution, a period of global change that reached its peak in the mid-1800s with the invention of new technologies such as electric motors, consumer manufacturing, and photography. As a result of these developments, ways of life changed rapidly—densely populated cities and factory work grew, new forms of travel emerged, and global connections became more accessible."</blockquote>

<div class="set"><h3>What is Modern Art?</h3>
<em>(from <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/modern-art/what-is-modern-art" target="_blank">MoMA.org's website</a>)</em><br />
<br />
<blockquote>"Before the 19th century, artists were most often commissioned to make artwork by wealthy patrons or institutions like the church. Much of this art depicted religious or mythological scenes that told stories intended to instruct the viewer. During the 19th century, many artists started to make art based in their own, personal experiences and about topics that they chose. With the publication of psychologist Sigmund Freud’s <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em> (1899) and the popularization of the idea of a subconscious mind, many artists began exploring dreams, symbolism, and personal iconography as avenues for the depiction of their subjective experiences. Challenging the notion that art must realistically depict the world, some artists experimented with the expressive use of color, non-traditional materials, and new techniques and mediums. Among these new mediums was photography, whose invention in 1839 offered radical possibilities for depicting and interpreting the world.<br />
<br />
"MoMA collects work made after 1880, when the atmosphere was ripe for avant-garde artists to take their work in new, surprising, and modern directions."</blockquote>

<h3>About This Project</h3>

<br />

This interactive was made for the <strong>DATA73200: Interactive Data Visualization</strong> course by instructor Eleanor Frymire (<a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/people/ellie-frymire" target="_blank">bio</a>|<a href="https://elliefrymire.com/" target="_blank">site</a>), part of the <strong>CUNY Graduate Center's M.S. in Data Analysis and Visualization</strong> program (<a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/data-analysis-and-visualization" target="_blank">link</a>).<br />

<br />

Originally, the proposed scope aimed to provide an intuitive, browser-based "genre sampler" of 25 art movements from the 1700s to today. Focusing on mostly Western-centric painting and poster art, the project utilizes The Museum of Modern Art's diverse works as examples. By filtering, tagging, and visualizing MoMA's datasets (<a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection"  target="_blank">Github&nbsp;link</a>), it was meant as a working mockup to show students, art enthusiasts, and potential NYC tourists how modern styles evolved and influenced successive art movements in order to provide historical context and understanding of Western artistic shifts seen across MoMA's galleries.<br />

In the early days of Macromedia Flash, I created "virtual player trading cards" for the Milwaukee Brewers and Bucks, allowing users to browse line-ups with player photos and stats. Before that, I wrote an academic piece comparing the transgressive nature of Post-Impressionism (Vincent van Gogh) and Pop Art (Andy Warhol), highlighting their different motivations.<br />

<div class="set">From these concepts, the idea was collaborated on with classmates toward three feature goals:<br >
<ul>
<li> "Trading cards" on various pieces (artwork on front, gallery card info on back - here just shown as a gallery card).</li>
<li> Time slider with "pop-ups" of key works per period.</li>
<li> Gantt chart-ish visualization of overlapping art movement periods.</li>
</ul>
</div>

After looking at the MoMA dataset, the range of art movement genres and span of time was simplified to a more manageable dozen-of-the-century. Using a few online art history sources (<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/category/art-movement"  target="_blank">Google's Art &amp; Culture</a> section, <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement"  target="_blank">WikiArt</a>, and of course, <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/"  target="_blank">MoMA.org</a>),  a mix of data cleaning via Python and manual tagging via Excel, the original dataset of 150,890 listed artworks was pared down to about 6,700 pieces....<br />

<br />

<div class="set"><strong>Number of MoMA Pieces by Genre</strong><br />
363	... Abstract Expressionism<br />
212	... Art Nouveau<br />
895	... Conceptual Art<br />
1507 ... Cubism<br />
558	... Dadaism<br />
825	... Expressionism<br />
458	... Fauvism<br />
30	... Impressionism<br />
412	... Minimalism<br />
1043 ... Pop Art<br />
85 ... Post-Impressionism<br />
376 ... Surrealism<br /></div>

<br />

Finally, artists most representative of their genres (van Gogh for Post-Impressionism, Andre Derain for Fauvism, Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein for Pop Art) were used to narrow further to 12 artworks per genre. The original visualization tried to showcase everything in one SVG, but <em>huge</em> thanks to Prof. Frymire's feedback reminding me D3.js could just as easily manipulate the rest of a webpage's DOM - a lifesaver to finish the design.<br />
